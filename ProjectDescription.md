Project Description: Movie Reccomendation and Rating API
Our project will consist of a persistence layer that we use to store user profiles, movie ratings, reviews and watchlists. We would implement 
a search function where you can filter by a star rating system, as well as by name, director, genre, etc. Users will be able to search movies, create reviews with a respect movie rating, create watchlists, and recieve movie recommendations based upon the movies in their watchlists. We will also implement a rating system where you can review and rate movies, and the more ratings a specific movie has, the higher it goes up on a popularity scale. Then we will implement a most popular movies leaderboards as well as highest and lowest rated leaderboards.
