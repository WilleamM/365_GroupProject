<h2>Project Description</h2>
<h4>Song Reccomendation and Rating API</h4>
Our group will construct a music recommendation and popularity API, where users can discover, rate, and recommend music based on various criteria such as genre, mood, or user preferences. Users will be able to create playlists and receive music recommendations based upon the genre and "mood/vibe" of the songs currently in their playlists. Then there will be a trending page, where music can be "On fire", which will allow it to be recommended more to people and their playlist. Users will also be able to rate the music themselves, which will increase its chances to be on the trending page. Lastly, we will implement a search functionality, that will allow you to search for music based upon its artist, name, genre, and mood/vibe.  
It will include a persistence layer that consists of user accounts with their respective playlists, song preferences and ratings.
